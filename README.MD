# 👋 Hello from Team Peekaboo!

In this project, we have developed and tested models for:
- 🧑‍🦰 **Gender Classification**
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Face Matching**

Our main focus was to explore different approaches and push the model performance as close to optimal as possible. The implementation includes multiple techniques for gender classification and a reliable face-matching pipeline.
